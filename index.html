      <h3>What is a Keratin Treatment?</h3>
         
            <p>A keratin treatment is a chemical process that infuses hair with a protein called keratin—something your hair naturally contains. This protein smooths out the hair’s cuticle, reducing frizz, enhancing shine, and making your hair much easier to manage.

                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: A balayage appointment typically takes around 2'3 hours, depending on your hair length, thickness, and the specific technique being used. During the consultation, your stylist will discuss your desired result and give you an estimate of the time required.

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: Is balayage low maintenance <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A: Yes! One of the main benefits of balayage is that it requires less upkeep compared to traditional highlights. Since balayage is applied in a freehand manner, it grows out beautifully, with softer roots and less noticeable regrowth. For the best results, we recommend touch-ups every 8'12 weeks.

The technique can be customized based on your hair texture, length, and personal style preferences. During your consultation, our balayage specialists will assess your hair and recommend the best approach for you.
